# E-commerce Microservices Platform

A production-ready, scalable e-commerce platform built with Java Spring Boot microservices architecture.

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Core Infrastructure
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka Server for service registration and discovery
- **Configuration Management**: Spring Cloud Config Server for centralized configuration
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway for request routing and load balancing
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with shared security utilities

### Microservices
- **Product Catalog Service**: Manages products, categories, and inventory (MongoDB + Redis)
- **User Accounts Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profiles (PostgreSQL)
- **Shopping Cart Service**: Manages user shopping carts (Redis)
- **Order Processing Service**: Processes orders asynchronously (RabbitMQ)

### Observability & Monitoring
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Zipkin for distributed tracing
- **Metrics**: Micrometer with Spring Boot Actuator

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Running the Infrastructure

1. Start the infrastructure services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d mongodb postgresql redis rabbitmq elasticsearch kibana logstash zipkin
```

2. Start the service discovery:
```bash
cd service-discovery
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. Start the config server:
```bash
cd config-server
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Building the Project

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Running Individual Services

Each microservice can be run independently:

```bash
cd [service-name]
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Development

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] Parent Maven project with multi-module structure
- [x] Common models and DTOs
- [x] Shared security utilities
- [x] Eureka Server for service discovery
- [x] Spring Cloud Config Server
- [x] Docker Compose for local development

### Phase 2: Core Microservices (In Progress)
